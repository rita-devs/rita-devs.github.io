If you have stumbled across this website, well done. I don't know how you found it, because I haven't advertised it anywhere, and there's not much here.

The intent of this website is to be a place where I can post things. I'm a software developer, so I'll post my side-projects here, and you can also find them on my [github](https://github.com/rita-devs). 

I also like to draw, so there'll be some pictures, and in general there'll be little collections of things that I've found. I don't know yet. This is new.

I hope you enjoy clicking around.
